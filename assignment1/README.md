# CS231n Project

This repository contains my work for the [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course.  
It includes implementations of neural network architectures, data processing scripts, and experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-10.

## Project Overview

- Implemented CNNs and related neural network models from scratch using Python and NumPy/PyTorch.
- Experimented with image classification tasks on CIFAR-10.
- Focused on understanding forward/backward passes, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up a local Python environment.
Make sure you have Python >= 3.7, <= 3.11, as autoreload is deprecated in 3.12.

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd cs231n
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/MacOS
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Notes for each assignment

Assignment 1: run cs231n/datasets/script.py to download CIFAR-10 dataset
